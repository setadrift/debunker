# Enhanced Bias Analysis System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Goal
Overhaul the news source bias system to find blind spots and biases in articles, providing alternative views and historically accurate context using academic sources and LLM analysis.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema
Created comprehensive new database models for sophisticated bias analysis:

- **`AcademicSource`** - Historical documents, research papers, and authoritative sources
- **`BiasAnalysis`** - Individual bias analysis reports with blind spot identification
- **`FactCheck`** - Fact-checking results against academic sources
- **`AlternativePerspective`** - AI-generated counter-narratives and missing context
- **Enhanced `SourceBias`** - Multi-dimensional bias scoring system

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Bias Detection
Expanded beyond simple left/right classification to include:

- **Political Bias** (-1.0 to 1.0) - Left vs right political orientation
- **Factual Accuracy** (0.0 to 1.0) - Truth and reliability scoring
- **Emotional Tone** (-1.0 to 1.0) - Negative vs positive sentiment
- **Sensationalism Score** (0.0 to 1.0) - Detection of inflammatory content
- **Confidence Scoring** - AI assessment confidence levels

### 3. Academic Source Integration
Built a comprehensive academic reference system:

- **10 Sample Academic Sources** loaded covering Iran-Israel conflict history
- **Credibility Scoring** based on citations and source type
